# Version Consistency Recommendation

To ensure compatibility across all services, standardize on the following versions:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <spring-boot.version>3.2.5</spring-boot.version>
    <spring-cloud.version>2023.0.1</spring-cloud.version>
</properties>
```

Update the following POM files:
1. Parent POM (already has correct versions)
2. Eureka Server: Upgrade from Spring Boot 3.2.0 to 3.2.5 and Spring Cloud 2023.0.0 to 2023.0.1
3. User Service, File Service, Repository Service: Check and update if necessary
